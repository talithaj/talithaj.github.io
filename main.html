      <p> Life is short, though I keep this from my children.

      <p>
        Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine

      <p>
        in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,

      <p>
        a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
      </p>
      <p>
        fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
      </p>
      <p>
        estimate, though I keep this from my children.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
      </p>
      <p>
        For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
      </p>
      <p>
        sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
      </p>
      <p>
        is at least half terrible, and for every kind
      </p>
      <p>
        stranger, there is one who would break you,
      </p>
      <p>
        though I keep this from my children. I am trying
      </p>
      <p>
        to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
      </p>
      <p>
        walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
      </p>
      <p>
        about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
      </p>
      <p>
        right? You could make this place beautiful.

      Hold my hand while you swipe on your phone

    <h2> Slats
    </h2>
    <p>
      Have you ever seen a house when it burns?
    </p>
    <p> The slats in the walls all stand out, like something we aren't meant to see.
    </p>
    <p> The structure of the thing; its bones.
    </p>
    <p> You see the same of a long abandoned house too, bones.
    </p>
   <p> Picked clean, waiting to be finally broken  by the weights of its roof,
    </p>
    <p> or rotted through by years of rain and sun,
    </p>
    <p> molding, rotting, drying up into earth and dust.
    </p>
    <p> Just like us, in the end, going back to earth and dust.
    </p>
   <p> In life, nourished by them.
    </p>
    <p> In death, the earth has returned what it  freely gave.
    </p>
    <p> Freely? Perhaps not, but it does not seem a price too high,
    </p>
   <p> to touch the sun and smell the rain,
    </p>
   <p> for a little while, at least.
